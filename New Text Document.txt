	CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY

"Hey, I just remembered, what about my parents? How can I live without telling them? They would worry about me." Yash said.

But before Caret could answer, Yash's mind was already racing with another thought. “But wait a minute," he said, "if I'm from Astronova and my parents are from Earth, that means they aren't my real parents. So who are they? Who is my real mom and dad?”

Caret couldn't help but burst out laughing at Yash's sudden outburst. "Hahahahaha! Relax Yash, don't worry. They are your real parents, and they both are from Astronova. In fact, they already know the truth about you," Caret reassured him.

Yash's face immediately lit up with relief. "Really? That's great news," he said, feeling a weight lifted off his shoulders. "But wait, why didn't they tell me about it?"

Caret looked at Yash with a reassuring smile. "It was better not to tell you anything until the time came. Your parents will be able to explain everything to you much better than I can. They were also unaware that the time has arrived." 

“So, where are they now?” Yash asked.

Caret's replied, “They left for Astronova sometime before." he explained.

“So, why they didn’t take me with them. Why we aren’t going together”, Yash asked Caret.

Caret sighed heavily. “Going back together is not safe for all of us. Everyone is after you right now. Going back to Astronova together would only put your parents and us in danger. We need to be careful.”

With a fierce glint in his eye Caret said, “Look over there, Yash. We've arrived. It’s my Staridier. It is a Hyperspace Cruiser. We can travel through one universe to another with the speed faster than light by this Hyperspace Cruiser.”

Yash's eyes widened in amazement as he gazed at the sleek, silver Staridier in front of him. "This is incredible!" he exclaimed. "I never imagined that I would travel in space, and this name Hyperspace Cruiser, this name just makes me feel that how wonderful this space vehicle and our journey would be!" he added.

“Make a habit of such vehicles now.” said caret with a playful smile, “Lets hurry now, we need to cover a big distance in very less time.”

Both Caret and Yash entered in the Silver and shiny Staridier. The silver exterior gleamed in the light, while the sharp, pointed structure at the front gave the impression of a ship that was built for speed. At the back, the craft had a slight elevation, as if it was poised to take off at any moment. The ship had a sleek and elongated body, with two large wings jutting out from the sides. As they walked in, Caret showed Yash the destructive laser cannons which were curved triangular structured in shape. The interior walls of cruiser were covered in a web-like pattern of glowing blue lights. The central area of the ship was dominated by a massive cylindrical chamber, which housed the ship's hyperspace engine. Caret explained that these cylinders are filled with energy plasmas. He further explained that energy plasmas were the form of energy made by compressing the gravitational energy, heat energy and energy extracted from Clustens. Clustens were the route which are created at different locations due to the space-time fluctuations which can connect one cluster to another. Yash was completely shocked by hearing about such an advanced technology. He was assured that it’s just a beginning, there is more such things eagerly waiting for him. 

Caret piloted the Staridier and initiated takeoff procedures. In a matter of seconds, the sleek ship soared high above the earth's atmosphere, leaving the blue and green planet far behind. Yash's jaw dropped in amazement as he watched the world shrink in the distance, awestruck by the speed and agility of the cruiser.

Caret turned to Yash and said, "We have a long journey ahead of us, so I suggest you to get some rest."

Yash replied, "Even though it's a long journey, with this speed of the cruiser, we might reach Astronova in just next few seconds."

“Not really Yash, Universe is not such small. We have to travel through this universe to the universe where Zorgonax, the cluster of Zorgonax Dominion is located. Hyperspace is path for hyperdriving, means passing through is one universe to another, and this needs a lot of energy plasma and time.” Yash nodded with a positive sign of understanding. 

After a moment, a brilliant white light materialized, enveloping everything in its path. Carret quickly elucidated that they were currently hyperdriving through a hyperspace. “The energy levels in this realm are immense, if we would be out of this cruiser, then our body be squeezed as a needle point due the high energy density” he explained, gesturing toward the luminous surroundings. “It's both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time.” Yash spoke in a trembled voice.

After a few hours of travel, they finally arrived in the universe of the Zorgonax Dominion. Both of them took the opportunity to rest for a while. Caret worked on some high-tech equipment in the Starider system. It was clear that he was trying to track something. Suddenly, a series of beeps rang out from the system, Caret focused intently on the screen in front of him. It was indicating that they had found a Clusten connecting with Zorgonax Cluster. Caret turned to Yash excitedly and said ,“We can travel to Zorgonax from this Clusten. It's a bit of a distance from here. We would to travelling through this Clusten and then we will be at of destination Zorgonax Dominion.” Yash too got excited listening to Caret.

Caret dived in that clusten as they reach there and informed Yash “In some time we will be at the other end of this clusten, that is Zorgonax Dominion.”

Yash turned to Caret with a question. "From there, we'll be able to travel to any of the nine galaxies, correct?” he asked.

Caret nodded in agreement. "Yes, that's right," he replied." Once we reach the end of this Clusten, we'll have access to a network of nine galaxies.

Yash couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement at the thought of exploring these galaxies. "I can't wait to see what's out there," he said with a grin. "Let's get going!".

But, Yash's excitement for adventure was suddenly replaced with fear as they witnessed the horrifying scene of battle unfold before them as they emerged from the clusten. In front of them were two spacecraft, resembling Hyperspace Cruisers, and one spacecraft that was much different from the both.

“A Warpjet!” Caret spoke in frightening voice. “It’s a danger situation for us now”.
